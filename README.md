### Twilight Engine ###

This is a little wrapper for a few simple libraries and helpers to make game construction more efficient.

There are a lot of engines out there that would likely be a better choice than this one - I'm building this
largely because I like to keep things relatively simple, and because the model and the framework make sense
to me (read: I wrote them, so they should).

The intent is to support Windows, OS/X, and Linux ... with possible (eventual) support for e.g. Emscripten
as well.
