### LEAPS! ###

A GameJam submission for November 2019.  Always good to do these things once in a while to keep one's skills sharp and all that.

While I'm hoping to walk away with a fun game at the end, I have a few personal goals:

* Generate all the assets used by this game (e.g. NO LICENSING ISSUES!  HUZZAH!)
* Learn how to compose simple musical scores and generate sounds
* Learn a little more about / get some practice with C++11
* Put something interesting together that isn't for work
* Keep things open - if someone wants to suffer through reviewing this code in detail, they're welcome to

### Twilight Engine ###

This is a little wrapper for libraries and helpers to make game construction more efficient.

There are a lot of engines out there that would likely be a better choice than this one - I'm building this
largely because I like to keep things relatively simple, and because the model and the framework make sense
to me (read: I wrote them, so they should).
